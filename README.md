## Design

CarCar is made up of 3 microservices which interact with one another.

- **Inventory**
- **Services**
- **Sales**

## Integration - How we put the "team" in "team"

Our Inventory and Sales domains work together with our Service domain to make everything here at **CarCar** possible.

How this all starts is at our inventory domain. We keep a record of automobiles on our lot that are available to buy. Our sales and service microservices obtain information from the inventory domain, using a **poller**, which talks to the inventory domain to keep track of which vehicles we have in our inventory so that the service and sales team always has up-to-date information.
