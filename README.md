## Design

CarCar is made up of 3 microservices which interact with one another.

- **Inventory**
- **Services**
- **Sales**

## Integration - How we put the "team" in "team"

Our Inventory and Sales domains work together with our Service domain to make everything here at **CarCar** possible.

How this all starts is at our inventory domain. We keep a record of automobiles on our lot that are available to buy. Our sales and service microservices obtain information from the inventory domain, using a **poller**, which talks to the inventory domain to keep track of which vehicles we have in our inventory so that the service and sales team always has up-to-date information.

# Sales Microservice

On the backend, the sales microservice has 4 models: AutomobileVO, Customer, SalesPerson, and SalesRecord. SalesRecord is the model that interacts with the other three models. This model gets data from the three other models.

The AutomobileVO is a value object that gets data about the automobiles in the inventory using a poller. The sales poller automotically polls the inventory microservice for data, so the sales microservice is constantly getting the updated data.

The reason for integration between these two microservices is that when recording a new sale, you'll need to choose which car is being sold and that information lives inside of the inventory microservice.
